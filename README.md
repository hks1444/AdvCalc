PURPOSE
  Our main purpose in building this advanced calculator was helping computer engineering students when they learn bitwise operations. However, this calculator is not only for students, computer engineers or scientists can use this program. The calculator can help them in hardware design since this calculations are not the type of equations that people would love to do just by themselves. The operations in this calculator are also helpful for data encryption or data compression algorithms.

HOW TO USE
The calculator supports ... calculations. All of them require two inputs except for "not" operation. "not" requires only one input. These inputs are not supposed to be only variables or numbers, they can be expressions too. (for example, xor(ls(1,1),1) is a valid input).

The calculator has memory feature. This means you can store data in a variable. In order to do this, you have to assign a value to a variable as shown below. The variable name has to appear before the equal sign and the part after the equal sign should be the value/expression that you want to assign to the variable. (when you assign an expression the calculator will not remember the expression, it will just remember the result of the expression). 

The variable names can only include the letters in the English alphabet. Also, variables are case-sensitive.
When you try to reach a variable which has not been introduced before, its value will be assumed as 0.

You can write comments in your inputs to help you remember things (?) when you do long calculation. To do this, all you have to do is type "%". When the compiler sees "%" in your input it will ignore what is written after it.

Any other character than the ones that are explained above will cause error in the program.

When an error occurs you will see the script "Error!" on your screen. When an input causes an error, the input will be ignored but the variables which were introduced before will not be lost.

When you want the see the value of a variable, you have to type the name of the variable, the calculator will return the value

When you want to make a calculation but not to store the value, you have to type the equation directly. The calculator will retuen the result on the screen.

When the calculator is ready to receive your input you will see "> " on your screen.
When the calculator prints an outputs, "> " does not appear, the screen only shows the output
