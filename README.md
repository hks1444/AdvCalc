# AdvCalc
PURPOSE
  Our main purpose in building this advanced calculator was helping computer engineering students when they learn bitwise operations. However, this calculator is not only for students, computer engineers or scientists can use this program. The calculator can help them in hardware design since this calculations are not the type of equations that people would love to do just by themselves. The operations in this calculator are also helpful for data encryption or data compression algorithms.
